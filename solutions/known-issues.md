### Code Security

#### Duplicate Committer Billing from Email Variations
- **JIRA:** PROJ-1747
- **Affected Versions:** All
- **Symptoms:** Same developer counted multiple times as separate committers due to different email addresses (work email, personal email, GitHub noreply variations). Results in unexpected billing spikes.
- **Example:** 
  - `developer@company.com` → Committer 1
  - `developer@gmail.com` → Committer 2 (same person!)
  - `developer@users.noreply.github.com` → Committer 3 (same person!)
- **Root Cause:** Code Security billing based on `author_email` field from git commits, NOT GitHub user ID. No email deduplication.
- **Workaround:** 
  1. Standardize git email configs across team:
     ```bash
     git config --global user.email "work@company.com"
     ```
  2. Review GitHub email settings: https://github.com/settings/emails
  3. Disable scanning on repositories with many inactive contributors
  4. Check committer breakdown using metrics:
     ```
     datadog.estimated_usage.code_security.sast.committers by {author_email}
     datadog.estimated_usage.code_security.sca.committers by {author_email}
     ```
- **Status:** Product limitation - No fix planned Q1 2026. Product team confirmed will not address this quarter.
- **Customer Impact:** High frustration, unexpected costs, lack of visibility into who is being counted
- **Related Zendesk Cases:** ZD-2488538, ZD-2267949, ZD-2349706
- **Documentation:** See `cases/ZD-2488538/INVESTIGATION_SUMMARY.md` for detailed troubleshooting

#### Bot Accounts Not Filtered in Committer Billing
- **JIRA:** PROJ-1747 (related)
- **Affected Versions:** All
- **Symptoms:** CI/CD automation bots (Dependabot, Renovate, custom bots) counted as committers, causing unexpected billing
- **Known Filtered Bots:** `noreply@github.com`, `actions@github.com`, `*@users.noreply.github.com`
- **Known Gaps:** Bot email format variations may slip through filters
- **Workaround:** 
  1. Disable Code Security scanning on repos where bots are primary committers
  2. Navigate to Code Security > Setup and toggle off specific repositories
- **Status:** Feature request for configurable bot filtering - no ETA
- **Related Zendesk Cases:** ZD-2488538
- **Documentation:** See `cases/ZD-2488538/INVESTIGATION_SUMMARY.md`

#### No Visibility into Committer Breakdown in UI
- **JIRA:** None (product gap)
- **Affected Versions:** All
- **Symptoms:** Customers cannot see which specific email addresses are being billed as committers in the Datadog UI
- **Impact:** Customers unable to self-diagnose billing spikes, must contact support
- **Workaround:** 
  - TSEs/TEEs must query Metrics Explorer:
    ```
    datadog.estimated_usage.code_security.sast.committers by {author_email}
    datadog.estimated_usage.code_security.sca.committers by {author_email}
    ```
  - Can also segment by `repository` and `git_provider`
- **Status:** Feature request - Add committer breakdown view in Code Security UI - no ETA
- **Related Zendesk Cases:** ZD-2488538, ZD-2267949, ZD-2349706
