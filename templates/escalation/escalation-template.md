## Example: Good Escalation

**Summary:** APM - Python tracer causing application memory leak in Django 4.2

**Environment:**
- **Customer:** Acme Corp (ZD-12345)
- **Datadog Agent Version:** 7.50.1
- **Host OS:** Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- **Runtime/Language:** Python 3.11, Django 4.2.7, ddtrace 2.6.0
- **Deployment Method:** Kubernetes (EKS)
- **Region:** US1
- **Number of Hosts Affected:** 15 pods

**Issue Description:**
Application memory usage continuously grows until pods are OOM killed. Memory growth stops when ddtrace is disabled. Issue started after upgrading from ddtrace 2.5.0 to 2.6.0.

**Expected Behavior:**
Memory usage should remain stable over time with tracer enabled.

**Actual Behavior:**
Memory usage grows ~50MB/hour per pod until reaching memory limit (2GB) and being OOM killed.

**Impact:**
- Pods being killed every 8-12 hours
- Service disruptions during pod restarts
- Increased infrastructure costs from scaling up

**Reproduction Steps:**
1. Deploy Django 4.2 app with ddtrace 2.6.0
2. Monitor pod memory usage over 8 hours
3. Observe continuous memory growth
4. Disable ddtrace → memory usage stabilizes

**Reproducibility:** Always - happens on all 15 pods consistently

**Investigation Summary:**

**What We've Tried:**
- Downgraded to ddtrace 2.5.0 → Issue goes away
- Tested with minimal tracer config → Issue persists
- Enabled tracer debug logs → No obvious errors
- Memory profiling shows growth in tracer internals

**What We've Ruled Out:**
- Application code leak (issue only occurs with tracer)
- Agent version (tested with multiple agent versions)
- Configuration issue (minimal config still leaks)
- Django version (tested 4.2.5, 4.2.6, 4.2.7 - all leak)

**Relevant Logs/Data:**

Memory growth chart: [attached screenshot]

Tracer debug logs showing trace volume:
```
2026-02-04 10:15:23 | DEBUG | Traced request: POST /api/orders (15ms)
2026-02-04 10:15:24 | DEBUG | Traced request: GET /api/products (8ms)
[~50 requests/second]
```

**Why This Needs Escalation:**
Memory leak appears to be in ddtrace 2.6.0 itself (regression from 2.5.0). Needs engineering investigation into tracer memory management changes between versions.

**Customer Priority:**
- **Severity:** High
- **Business Impact:** Production service stability compromised
- **Urgency:** Need resolution within 1 week
- **Workaround Available:** Yes - downgrade to ddtrace 2.5.0 (customer testing now)

**Additional Context:**
- Similar case: PROJ-1234 (memory leak in Java tracer, fixed in 1.2.3)
- Checked release notes: ddtrace 2.6.0 mentioned "improved memory efficiency" - possible regression?
- Customer can provide heap dumps if needed
